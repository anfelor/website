# Anton Lorenzen's blog

This is the code for the blog at [https://anfelor.github.io/blog/](https://anfelor.github.io/blog/).
It is based on the blog system in [https://github.com/anfelor/blog](https://github.com/anfelor/blog).

## Workflow

Install the [steeloverseer](https://github.com/schell/steeloverseer) and execute `sos` on the command line.
This will launch the `sass` and `tsc` binaries, so please make sure you have them installed.

**DANGER!** Every rebuild overwrites the `blog/` directory! Never modify/store anything in there!
